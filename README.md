## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for a distributed multiplayer shooter game implemented using Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation). The system employs a client-server architecture where the first player acts as both host and client, managing the authoritative game state while other players connect as remote clients. The game features real-time multiplayer interaction on a 10x10 grid with shooting, healing, and movement mechanics, incorporating Lamport's logical clocks for event ordering and XOR encryption for secure message transmission.

## 2. System Architecture Overview

### 2.1 Architectural Pattern
The system implements a **Hybrid Client-Server with Player-as-Host** model:
- **Host Player**: Runs both server logic (`Host.java`) and client logic (`Client.java`)
- **Client Players**: Run only client logic, connecting to the host's RMI registry
- **Communication**: Pure RMI for all interactions (no socket layer)
- **Security**: XOR encryption for message confidentiality

### 3.2 Interface Design

#### 3.2.1 HostI Interface
```java
public interface HostI extends Remote {
    Player registerPlayer(Player p) throws RemoteException;
    List<Player> getPlayers() throws RemoteException;
    void multicastMessage(byte[] encryptedMessage) throws RemoteException;
    void registerClientStub(String playerId, ClientI stub) throws RemoteException;
}
```

#### 3.2.2 ClientI Interface
```java
public interface ClientI extends Remote {
    void receiveMulticast(byte[] encryptedMessage) throws RemoteException;
    void updateGameState(List<Player> players) throws RemoteException;
}
```

## 4. Communication Flow

### 4.1 Game Initialization Sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U1 as User 1 (Host)
    participant C1 as Client.java (Host)
    participant H as Host.java
    participant R as RMI Registry
    participant U2 as User 2 (Client)
    participant C2 as Client.java (Client)
    
    U1->>C1: Choose "Create Game"
    C1->>R: createRegistry(1099)
    C1->>H: new Host()
    C1->>R: rebind("HostService", host)
    C1->>C1: Register as hostInternalClient
    
    U2->>C2: Choose "Join Game"
    U2->>C2: Enter Host IP
    C2->>R: lookup("HostService")
    R-->>C2: HostI stub
    C2->>H: registerPlayer(player)
    H-->>C2: Updated Player object
    C2->>H: registerClientStub(playerId, clientStub)
```

### 4.2 Game Action Processing Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant H as Host
    participant C1 as Other Client 1
    participant C2 as Other Client 2
    
    C->>C: User inputs action
    C->>C: Increment logical clock
    C->>C: Create Message object
    C->>C: Serialize & encrypt message
    C->>H: multicastMessage(encryptedMessage)
    H->>H: Decrypt & deserialize
    H->>H: Update sender's logical clock
    H->>H: Add to event queue
    H->>C: receiveMulticast(encryptedMessage)
    H->>C1: receiveMulticast(encryptedMessage)
    H->>C2: receiveMulticast(encryptedMessage)
    H->>H: executeEvents()
    Note over H: Process events in total order
```

## 5. Security Design

### 5.1 Encryption Mechanism
- **Algorithm**: XOR cipher with fixed key (0x5A)
- **Purpose**: Message confidentiality during transmission
- **Implementation**: `EncryptionUtils.xorEncryptDecrypt()`
- **Application**: All game messages encrypted before RMI transmission

### 5.2 Security Considerations
- **Limitations**: XOR with fixed key provides minimal security
- **Improvements**: Could be enhanced with stronger encryption (AES, RSA)
- **Authentication**: Basic player ID validation
- **Authorization**: Host controls all game state modifications

## 6. Concurrency and Synchronization

### 6.1 Logical Clock Implementation
- **Algorithm**: Lamport's Logical Clocks
- **Purpose**: Event ordering in distributed system
- **Update Rule**: `clock = max(local_clock, received_clock) + 1`
- **Application**: Ensures consistent event ordering across all clients

### 6.2 Event Ordering
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Message Arrives] --> B[Update Logical Clock]
    B --> C[Add to Priority Queue]
    C --> D[Process by Clock Value]
    D --> E[Break ties by Timestamp]
    E --> F[Final tie-break by Player ID]
    F --> G[Execute Action]
```

### 6.3 Synchronization Points
- **Host.java**: All methods synchronized for thread safety
- **Event Queue**: Priority queue ensures total ordering
- **Player List**: Synchronized access for concurrent modifications

## 7. Game Mechanics

### 7.1 Game World
- **Grid Size**: 10x10 coordinate system
- **Player Placement**: Host at (5,5), others random
- **Boundaries**: Movement constrained to grid limits
- **Visualization**: ASCII-based map with player symbols

### 7.2 Player Actions

#### Movement
- **Directions**: up, down, left, right
- **Constraints**: Grid boundaries (0-9 for both x,y)
- **Validation**: Host checks bounds before updating position

#### Combat System
- **Shooting**: Reduces target health by 10 points
- **Healing**: Increases target health by 10 points
- **Range Limit**: Euclidean distance â‰¤ 3 units
- **Health Range**: 0-100 points
- **Self-targeting**: Prohibited for shooting

### 7.3 Player Identification
- **Symbol Generation**: Sequential assignment (a-z, A-Z)
- **ID Validation**: Case-insensitive matching
- **Reserved IDs**: "hostInternalClient" reserved for host

## 8. Error Handling and Resilience

### 8.1 Network Error Handling
- **Connection Failures**: Graceful degradation with user notification
- **RMI Exceptions**: Specific handling for RemoteException
- **Registry Issues**: Automatic retry for existing registry
- **Host Disconnection**: Client exit when host unreachable

### 8.2 Input Validation
- **Command Parsing**: Robust parsing with error messages
- **Player ID Validation**: Existence checking before action execution
- **Action Validation**: Type and parameter verification
- **Range Checking**: Distance validation for combat actions

## 9. Deployment Architecture

### 9.1 Network Configuration
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Host Machine (IP: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)"
        H[Host Application]
        R[RMI Registry :1099]
        H --> R
    end
    
    subgraph "Client Machine 1"
        C1[Client Application]
    end
    
    subgraph "Client Machine 2"
        C2[Client Application]
    end
    
    C1 -.->|RMI Connection| R
    C2 -.->|RMI Connection| R
    
    H -.->|Multicast Updates| C1
    H -.->|Multicast Updates| C2
```

### 9.2 System Requirements
- **Java Version**: Java 8 or higher
- **Network**: TCP/IP connectivity between all nodes
- **Ports**: 1099 (RMI Registry), dynamic ports for RMI objects
- **Memory**: Minimal requirements for small-scale multiplayer
